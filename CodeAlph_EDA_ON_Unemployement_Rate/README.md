# Unemployment Analysis in India During Covid-19 Using Python

## Introduction

This project analyzes unemployment trends in India before and during the Covid-19 pandemic using Python. The goal is to understand how lockdown measures impacted unemployment, employment, and labour participation, and to observe the recovery phase.

Two datasets were used:

- Dataset 1: May 2019 – June 2020 (pre-Covid and early Covid period)
- Dataset 2: January 2020 – October 2020 (Covid impact and recovery period)

Data cleaning included removing empty rows, checking duplicates, converting the Date column to datetime format, and aggregating state-level data into national monthly averages.

## Unemployment Trend Analysis

Both datasets show that unemployment remained stable at approximately **9–10% before Covid-19**. Starting in March 2020, unemployment increased sharply and **peaked between April and May 2020 at around 22–25%**, corresponding with nationwide lockdown restrictions.

After June 2020, unemployment gradually declined and stabilized between **8–11%**, indicating economic recovery as restrictions were eased.

The consistency across both datasets confirms the significant impact of Covid-19 lockdown on unemployment.

## Employment Trend Analysis

Employment levels remained stable before the pandemic but experienced a **sharp decline in April 2020**, reaching the lowest point during lockdown.

Following this drop, employment steadily recovered from June 2020 onward and eventually stabilized near pre-pandemic levels.

This inverse relationship between employment and unemployment confirms the extent of job losses during lockdown and subsequent workforce recovery.

## Labour Participation Rate Analysis

Labour participation remained stable at approximately **43–44% before Covid-19**, but dropped significantly to around **35% in April 2020**, reflecting workforce withdrawal due to lockdown restrictions.

Both datasets show gradual recovery after June 2020, stabilizing around **41–42%**, indicating normalization of workforce participation.

## Final Conclusion

Both datasets consistently demonstrate that Covid-19 had a severe but temporary impact on India's labour market.

**Key findings:**

- Unemployment spiked sharply during lockdown (April–May 2020)
- Employment declined significantly during the same period
- Labour participation dropped due to workforce disruption
- Recovery began after lockdown restrictions were eased
- Economic indicators stabilized by late 2020

This analysis demonstrates how data analysis can be used to understand real-world economic disruptions and workforce trends.
